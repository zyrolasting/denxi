Denxi is an [ecosystem-oriented ecosystem](./docs/eoe.txt). It reduces
the cost of producing package managers, downloaders, storefronts,
operating systems, CI/CD systems, and other platforms built by user
data.

You are in Denxi's target audience if you like the idea of a package
manager being a personal tool, like a pocket knife. In Denxi
semantics, your pocket package manager lets you receive interdependent
data from arbitrary ecosystems, and respond to security incidents
without waiting on others.

This repository tracks core interfaces, and a minimal ecosystem for
using mTLS over TCP. Use this minimal basis to extend Denxi.

To install Denxi, run `setup.rkt` in an existing Racket installation.
