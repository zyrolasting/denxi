This product includes software developed by the OpenSSL Project
for use in the OpenSSL Toolkit. (http://www.openssl.org/)

This subsystem statically-links OpenSSL libraries across platforms to
provide a simplified interface for creating message digests, creating
signatures using assymetric keys, and verifying signatures. Each
architecture and operating system is represented using its own library.
