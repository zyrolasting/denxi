A workspace is a directory that Xiden uses to hold its state. Each
workspace is assumed to be self-contained. Details: `raco doc
workspace L:xiden/state`

You can see the default workspace by running this command.  If you ran
another example, look there now to see a database and a
content-addressable filesystem. Links are issued from workspaces.

  racket -l racket/base -l xiden/state -e '(XIDEN_WORKSPACE)'

This example has two launchers that select different workspace
locations. Try them out to see where installations end up.

Once you have a workspace directory, open it up and look inside.
You'll find content-addressable files and links in an `objects`
directory, and a SQLite3 database called `db`. The database
is in sync with `objects` unless directly corrupted.

Protect workspaces! Xiden can't prevent or recover from direct
tampering.
