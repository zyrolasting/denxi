@title[#:tag "determinism"]{Protecting Determinism in Artifacts}

@tech/xiden-reference{Artifacts} that use the same correct integrity
information and signatures are guarenteed to produce the same bytes
from a trusted source, assuming bytes are produced.

This is great for reproducible builds, but handwriting such
information can slow you down. In the below example, changing the
source means changing the integrity information. Changing the
integrity information means changing the signature.

@racketblock[
(artifact (byte-source #"84n\24...")
          (integrity 'sha384 #"47u2c...")
          (signature #"fa9v\0..."
                     #"h!,094..."))
]

One can ease the chore using remote sources.

@racketblock[
(artifact (http-source "https://example.com/my-file")
          (integrity 'sha384 (http-source "https://example.com/my-file.sha384"))
          (signature
           (http-source "https://example.com/public.pem")
           (http-source "https://example.com/my-file.sha384.sig")))
]

This decouples the artifact from its content, and Xiden will still
protect the user from unwanted data by checking trust against public
keys, cryptographic hash functions, and network safety
limits. However, the act of fetching artifact data is no longer
deterministic because servers can go down, or return different
responses for the same request. If signature checking is disabled,
this arrangement is especially dangerous.

The first step towards determinism is hosting a local copy of at least
the integrity information. This does not make the build fully
reproducible because the content and signature might be unavailable.
Local integrity still makes a difference because you or your team
asserts what bytes are correct, and not an external source. Lock files
are built on this premise for other dependency managers.

Lock files are not necessary when you leverage Xiden's design, which
caches all fulfilled data. When you install software starting from
zero-trust, a successful installation implies that your system
contains an integrous copy of authenticated data. You can either check
your @tech/xiden-reference{workspace} into source control, archive it
for distribution as a file, and write a package definition to download
that workspace. You may need to sign the archive or commit for others
to decide if they trust your distribution. When the workspace is sent
to another user's system, the links may be invalid, but the data will
be locally present. This means that when a user installs package
definitions, outputs will be reused normally. On the other hand,
collecting garbage before installing anything will delete everything
in that workspace unless symbolic links are preserved in the transfer.
