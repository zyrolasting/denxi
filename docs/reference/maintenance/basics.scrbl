@title{Basic Information}

To build all project deliverables, run @litchar{make} or @litchar{make
build}. To run the tests, run @litchar{make test}. To do both, run
@litchar{make build test}.

Denxi is versioned according to @secref["versioning" #:doc
denxi-guide] in published package definitions. Do not follow the
versioning scheme defined in @secref["Package_Concepts" #:doc '(lib
"pkg/scribblings/pkg.scrbl")], even in the @litchar{info.rkt} file.


@section{User Experience Notice}

Instead of an @tt{install} or @tt{uninstall} command, Denxi expects a
user to define transactions with the filesystem and request links (read:
references) to the exact files they need. Some users might not appreciate an
unconventional interface, so some push-back is expected.

Maintainers should refrain from adding aliases that conform to traditional
package manager commands to Denxi, because they would not contribute
functionality. They should instead suggest defining such aliases as shell
scripts, which is a better medium for user preferences.

A more actionable complaint would address Denxi's current requirement
for Racket values by every flag, including boolean short flags
(e.g. @litchar{-U '#t'}). This is a combination of
@racket[parse-command-line]'s interpretation of procedure arity and
Denxi's insistence on full ability to override the runtime
configuration through several means.


@section{Security Notice}

Like any system that runs code from the Internet, Denxi can be used for
nefarious purposes. This attack surface is made complicated due to differences
in how Windows and Unix-like systems model permissions, and the flexibility of
Denxi's runtime configuration.  Denxi offers security
features to mitigate some risks, but administrators should configure their
operating system to restrict the behavior of any user or group running a
Denxi process. Failing to do so allows room for arbitrary code
execution.
