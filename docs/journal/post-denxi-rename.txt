@title{Software Distribution; or The World's Most Boring Essay}
@summary{From zcpkg to Xiden}

@p{
The content you want determines the middleman program you need to get
it. If you want Angry Birds, then you go to the Play Store or the App
Store.  Some apps might not be available on either platform, so you
have to look around. The sames reasoning goes for music, where artists
may appear on Spotify but not YouTube.

@p{
I'm a programmer, but I'm still a user. I start @tt{pipenv} and
Netflix wishing that I didn't have to care about the difference.  I'm
surrounded by middlemen.  I ended up trying all of this after
wrestling with Racket's package manager.  I ended up writing my own
package manager called zcpkg, which was then renamed to
Xiden. Ironically, it is now pending another name change because
conspiracy theorists started calling Joe Biden "Xiden." Ruined the
search traffic, but that's another article.

@p{
Even without the naming issues, I have a hard time getting people to
understand what Xiden @italic{is}. Which is fair, since I sometimes
struggle to explain what I'm trying to do, and Xiden is not a package
manager. It is an attempt to model distribution as a domain, such that
one can quickly crank out middlemen programs italic{like} package
managers just like how Racket can quickly crank out new programming
languages.

@p{
If that sounded slightly less interesting than a plank's dream of
becoming a fence post, it might help to understand that I view a
package manager as a personal tool, like a pocket knife, or a
@tt{.bashrc}. It's not something I download and update, it's something
I open up and tweak as the world around me changes due to an
information security incident. If I want other people to see something
I can access, then I toss them my package manager and tell them the
command to run on it. Xiden also made it so that if you want to
install or update my software, you don't need my package manager. You
can use it, of course, but you can also write your own and still get
my software if your configuration is compatible.  My hope is if users
can write their own middlemen programs to control how data arrives on
their system, then they are better equipped to share work than the
communal bereaucracies that form around existing package managers.
