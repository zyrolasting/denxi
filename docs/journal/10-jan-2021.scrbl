I've started this development journal to track activity that does not
fit in a comment or a changelog.

I invite @bold{constructive} criticism in terms of what you read here.
That will help improve plans before any code changes.  I emphasize
“constructive,” because I am not being paid to work on Denxi. Those
who respect little red hens have my attention.
